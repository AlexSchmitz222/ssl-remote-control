# Run remote control on a Raspberry Pi

---
**Note** 

This is still work-in-progress.

---

This folder contains scripts to configure a Pi to run the remote control.
You can install a Raspberry Pi OS Lite and use the [bootstrap.sh](bootstrap.sh) script to set it up.

Some ideas:
- Use https://github.com/guysoft/FullPageOS to create an initial image
- Use https://github.com/RPi-Distro/pi-gen to create an initial image
